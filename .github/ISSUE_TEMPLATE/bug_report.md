4. See error

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**

**How are you deploying this?**
E.g. clicked on the "Deploy to Heroku" button (if so, which one?) from this repo/your fork, cloned this repository and set heroku remote and pushed to it.

Note that we don't support the "download the source code and try to deploy to heroku" and "git clone and copy the folder" deployment strategies. If these sound like what you're doing, try one of the officially supported deployment methods (see the `Deploy` section in the README). Otherwise, we can't help you!
